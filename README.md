# Transposon_analysis
Transposon analysis is to find similar sequences within the reference genome. Also you can extract transposon sililar sequences from the reference genome by using this script.

This repository contains a pipeline for identifying transposon sequences in genomic data. It includes:
- Adapter trimming with Fastp
- Read mapping using Bowtie2
- Conversion to sorted BAM format
- Extraction of mapped sequences
- Identification of insertion sites

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
bash transposon_pipeline.sh
